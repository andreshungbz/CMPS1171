Determine if the table below is Normalized. If it is not, then Normalize it up
to BCNF.

			TABLE_PURCHASE_DETAIL
			
CustomerID	StoreID	       Purchase Location
--------------------------------------------
1			            1				Los Angeles
1			            3				San Francisco
2			            1				Los Angeles
3		              2				New York
4			            3				San Francisco

Assumptions
CustomerID is a FK to a Customer table.

Functional Dependencies
StoreID --> Purchase Location

Not normalized because Determinant StoreID is not a candidate key. Normalize to BCNF.
Added Timestamp to TABLE_PURCHASE_DETAIL to make table unique

TABLE_PURCHASE_DETAIL (CustomerID PK FK, StoreID PK FK, Timestamp PK)
TABLE_PURCHASE_STORE (StoreID PK, Purchase Location)
