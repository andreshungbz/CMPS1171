CMPS1171 - Practice

1. Login as the postgres superuser and complete the following tasks:

	a. Create a database named bank.
	b. Create a new role for the bank database named bank. Be sure to set an appropriate 
   	   password for the bank role.
	c. Logout of the postgres account.

2. Login to the bank database (as user bank) that you just created and create
   a table named 'employees' in a file named 'tables.sql'. The 'employees' table should
   have the following column names and data types:
   	- employee_id serial PRIMARY KEY
   	- name text NOT NULL
        - job text NOT NULL
        - salary int NOT NULL
        
3. Insert five rows into the newly created 'employees' table. 
   The sql INSERT statements should be placed after the CREATE TABLE statement
   in the 'tables.sql' file. You only need to provide values for the name, job, and salary
   columns because the primary key column 'employee_id' will be automatically assigned a 
   value by PostgreSQL.
   
4. Write an sql query to see the five rows in the 'employees'. Place the query after
   the INSERT commands in the tables.sql file. Be sure to split the query into two
   lines like discussed on the video where SELECT is on one line and FROM is on the
   next line. List(sort) the employees by 'name' in descending order.
   
   
Logout out of the bank database when you have completed the tasks.
