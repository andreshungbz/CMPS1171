# CLASS EXERCISES â€“ Functional Dependency

1. Consider the table below:
   STAFF_MEETING(EmployeeName, ProjectName, Date)

The rows of this table record the fact that an employee
from a particular project attended a meeting on
the given date.

Note: Assume that a project meets at most once per day.
Also, assume that only one employee represents a given
project, but that employees can be assigned to multiple projects.

Question: Complete the blanks below to complete the two
functional dependencies for the table above

Hint: Fill out the table with a few rows
of sample data to aid your understanding of the problem.

a. ProjectName --> EmployeeName
b. (ProjectName, Date) --> EmployeeName

2. Consider the table below:
   STUDENT(StudentNumber, StudentName, Dorm, RoomType,
   DormCost, Club, ClubCost, Sibling, Nickname)

Note: Assume that students pay different dorm costs, depending
on the type of room they have, but that all members of
a club pay the same cost. Assume that students can have multiple
nicknames.

Hint: Fill out the table with a few rows
of sample data to aid your understanding of the problem.

a. StudentNumber --> StudentName
b. StudentNumber -->  Dorm
c. StudentNumber -->  RoomType
d. RoomType -->  DormCost
e. Club -->  ClubCost

STUDENT (studentnumber PK, studentname, dorm FK, club FK)
DORM (dorm PK, roomtype FK)
ROOMTYPE (roomtype PK, dormcost)
SIBLINGS (studentnumber PK FK, sibling PK)
NICKANMES (studentnumber PK FK, nickname PK)
