Determine if the table below is Normalized. If it is not, then Normalize it up
to BCNF.

STUDENT_GRADE(StudentNo, StudentName, Major, CourseNo, CourseName,
              InstructorNo, InstructorName, InstructorLocation, Grade)
			
Assumptions
Student can have multiple majors.
Student can take multiple courses.
Instructor can teach multiple courses nad has one location.

Functional Dependencies
StudentNo --> StudentName
CourseNo --> CourseName
InstructorNo --> InstructorName, InstructorLocation
StudentNo, CourseNo, InstructorNo --> Grade

Not normalized as every determinant is not a candidate key.
Mutlivalued dependencies exist so normalize to 4NF.
For STUDENT_GRADE, added semester field to make rows unique.

STUDENT (StudentNo PK, StudentName)
STUDENT_MAJOR (StudentNo PK FK, Major PK)
COURSE (CourseNo PK, CourseName)
INSTRUCTOR (InstructorNo PK, InstructorName, InstructorLocation)
STUDENT_GRADE (StudentNo PK FK, CourseNo PK FK, InstructorNo PK FK, Semester PK, Grade)
